            <p>Yes I know it sounds dumb but, if during your working hours you go to the toilet,
technically, <em>you are getting paid for it</em>. ðŸ’©</p>
<h1 id="use-case">Use case</h1>
<p>Alright, lets say you you earn $10 an hour and during those 8 hours of daily work, you go twice to the bathroom, for around 10 minutes each time.</p>
<p>Then a simple multiplication shows that your <em>&ldquo;poop time&rdquo;</em> is worth around <strong>$3.34</strong> per day!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 bucks an hour â‰ˆ $1,67, for 10 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right? So if you do this everyday, during an year, (taking in consideration that you work around 22 days a month),
then you get an astounding <strong>$881.76</strong> dollars a year, just for pooping!!</p>
<p>Your poop is worth the same as an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/slp/iPhone-10/j8tt3mgq5e3o3ah">iPhone 10</a>!!</p>
<h1 id="nfc-tags--zapier-to-the-rescue">NFC tags + Zapier to the rescue</h1>
<p>Well I wanted to know how much ðŸ’¸ I was making just by going to the bathroom during working hours and I needed something to keep track of my &ldquo;going and coming&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I started by writing in a excel sheet but that was really not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Well, I had some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stickers-Genuine-Memory-Strong-Adhesive/dp/B07FNX864J/ref=sr_1_10?crid=PQ05CV5E123S&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=nfc+tags&amp;qid=1591463153&amp;sprefix=external+har%2Caps%2C467&amp;sr=8-10">NFC tags</a>
laying around and I&rsquo;ve also had previously bought <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.nfctools.pro&amp;hl=pt_PT">NFC Tools</a>
so I just decide to play around with those.</p>
<h2 id="zapier-integration">Zapier Integration</h2>
<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t want to fill a Google Spreadsheet every time I went to the bathroom, I end up creating a <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/">Zapier</a> integration
with Google Spreadsheets, that would have an exposed web hook, which would be used by tapping the NFC tag.</p>
<p>It was a simple webhook that would store something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">
<table style="border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">1

</span></code></pre></td>
<td style="vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>creation_datetime	nfc_id	event_name	event_value
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2017-03-25 17:11:49	04:2d:d1:62:a1:48:80	take-a-shit	TRUE
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2017-03-25 17:14:53	04:2d:d1:62:a1:48:80	take-a-shit	FALSE
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>...<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>The important part is the <code> event_value</code> which would work as a toggle, in which <strong>True</strong> means &ldquo;Going to the bathroom&rdquo; and <strong>False</strong> &ldquo;Coming back&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="nfc-tag">NFC Tag</h2>
<p>I just wanted to have one tag, which I would tap with my phone and make the POST request to the Zapier webhook.</p>
<p>So, I just end up creating a new task on &ldquo;NFC Tools&rdquo; app that would make an HTTP Post request to Zapier with the expected <code>event_value</code>.</p>
<p><img src="nfc_tools_screenshot.png" alt="NFC Tools App"></p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Well long story short, I made <strong>$134.39</strong> during a period of <strong>8 months</strong>.</p>
