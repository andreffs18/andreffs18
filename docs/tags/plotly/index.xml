      <description>Well, after reading a couple of books on the topic, they all talk about the same thing: you should diversify your portfolio.
Code could not finish, this are some reasons why this happen. - Plot name not defined. The first parameter of the shortcode is the name. - There is a syntax error. check browser console.   function draw(){ test = document.getElementById(&#34;piechart&#34;); if (test == null){ console.log(&#34;The plot name is not defined&#34;</description>

Then a simple multiplication shows that your &amp;ldquo;poop time&amp;rdquo; is worth around $3.34 per day!</description>
