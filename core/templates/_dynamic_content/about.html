<h3 class="lead text-left">I'm André Silva, a {{ my_age }} y/old guy from Lisbon, that likes Startups, Coding, Surf and TV Shows.</h3><p>I consider myself one of the few lucky ones to have got the opportunity to work with the most hard working and passionate people that creates and builds Unbabel everyday. As a Tech Lead Engineer in one of the first Portuguese Startups to enter Y-combinator, I care deeply about turning complex problems into simple ones, fully understanding the system's architecture, from the backend to the frontend user experience.</p><p>I was also enrolled in one of the best engineering schools of Portugal, Instituto Superior Técnico, in a Bologna Degree in Information Systems and Computer Science Engineering. Even though I have not started my masters degree, I'm planning on enrolling on a MSc in Intelligent Systems and Distribuited Systems some time in the future.</p><p>As working on a startup can be super time consuming, I find myself without much time to procrastinate. So when I'm not at Unbabel, you'll probably find me in the Gym or training Self Defense (DPKC), "hackathoning" or just enjoying the great waves that Lisbon can give you.</p>
