            <h3 class="lead text-left">My name is André silva, I'm a 22 y/old guy from Lisbon, that likes startups, artificial intelligence, surf and tv shows.</h3>
            <p>I consider myself to be one of the few lucky ones to have got the opportunity to work with the most hard working and passionate people that creates and builds Unbabel everyday. As a Backend Enginner (wannabe Full-Stack) in one of the firsts Portuguese Startups to enter Y-combinator, I care about turning complex problems into simple ones, understanding all the systems architecture, front the backend to the frontend user experience.</p>
            <p>Although I work as a Backend Engineer @ one of the best Startups in Portugal, I'm also currently enrolled in the best engineering school of portugal, Instituto Superior Técnico, in a Bologna Degree in Information Systems and Computer Science Engineering. I'm planning on enrolling in a MSc in Intelligent Systems next year.</p>
            <p>As a full time worker/student, I find myself without much time to procrastinate, so when I'm not working or studying, you'll find me in the gym, training self defense, "hackathoning" or just enjoying the amazing waves that Lisbon can give you.</p>
            <!-- My passion lies in Artificial Intelligence. The naive idea of making the machine do all your work the minimum effort, learning by itself, is something that always intrigued me.-->
