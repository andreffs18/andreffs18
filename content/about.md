### ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is AndrÃ© Silva and I'm a {{< my_age >}} y/old Portuguese Software Engineer from Lisbon that likes to code.

### # A bit about me

I wasn't always focused on the development world.

During high school I got the change to internship on a consulting firm in my hometown, mainly working with setting up 
data centers, and configuring network systems.

After high school I went to college to take a Computer Science Bachelor. 
During that first few months I manage to participate in a couple of hackathons and startup projects, mostly just for fun, but always with the goal in mind to build experience and a curriculum. 
 
In that time I started to discover the growing startup scene in Lisbon and during the summer vacations got myself an internship 
at one of those startups (which end up failing, as most of them do).

Going back to my 2nd year of college, I was offered to be part of Unbabel, one of the first Portuguese startups to enter Y-combinator, which I been working there ever since.   

### # What I care about

I consider myself a backend engineer, that dabbles in frontend and is really invested in the devops world. 
I like to understand complex problems and turning them into simple ones, figuring out the whole systems architecture, from the users point of view, to the underlying stack. 

I mostly develop web base applications, but I'm also interested in the operational side of things like 
* automating manual tasks, 
* building easy processes for people to follow,
* writing maintainable, modular software,
* and creating pleasant and clear documentation  

### # Hobbies?

When I'm not working, I'm probably either cooking, watching tv shows, going to the gym or surfing.
