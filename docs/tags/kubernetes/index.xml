      <description>This post is a continuation on &amp;ldquo;Setup n8n on Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;, so most of the things we talk here assume that you&amp;rsquo;ve followed/read this one as well.
After running n8n during a couple of months in production, me and my team realized that the default configuration do not work very well for us.
So here in this post I go over the changes we did to allow n8n to scale and work without problems.</description>

You have your own n8n instance running in Kubernetes, taking advantage of all amazing functionality and capabilities of it, but you are still going in blind right now. I mean, how can you check if your service is healthy? Is it running? How much memory is it using?</description>

      <description>Update 2021-05-23: Decided to split this post into 3 different ones to be more easily read. You can find the other two here: &amp;ldquo;Observability on n8n&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;n8n customizations for Production&amp;rdquo;.
So at my company we started using n8n to setup some MVP&amp;rsquo;s, build workflows and glue together some of our internal tools in order to automate some of our processes.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to go over how we&amp;rsquo;ve deployed n8n on our Kubernetes Cluster.</description>

      <description>Its true, that if the time from developing a feature to deploying it to your customers only takes minutes to hours instead of days to months, that you probably have a pretty amazing development workflow.
Im also willing to bet that a key feature of that workflow is an impeccable CI/CD pipeline, that not only allows your development team to automate a lot of time consuming and manual tasks (like building, testing, deploying, etc) but also, shortens the feedback cycle between developing-&amp;gt;testing and testing-&amp;gt;production.</description>
