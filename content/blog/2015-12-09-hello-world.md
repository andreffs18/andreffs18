Hello ðŸ˜ƒ

So this is the mandatory _"Hello World"_ blog post. 

The intent of this blog is just to keep track of my achievements, projects and also
- Technical how-to/tutorials
- Bugs or gotchas that might be useful in the future
- Setup & configuration
- Stuff that I keep forgetting and keep googling.
