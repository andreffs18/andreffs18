My key takeaways from making this website "SEO friendly":

1. Use link "tree structure" from homepage. This way, bots and crawlers can find every page on the website

1. Good **titles**, under 65 characters

1. Meta tags with good keywords under 100 characters

1. Add "alt" tag to images

{{< highlight html "linenos=inline,linenostart=1" >}}

<img alt="About me picture" src="/images/about.jpeg">

{{< /highlight >}}
