      <description>Since this #remotelife began, sadly not for the best reasons, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to finally clean my backlog of, guess what, TV Shows, Games, Podcasts, Books&amp;hellip; Well, everything that a person is suppose to do!
Very happy was I until I remembered that, maybe I should start looking into the &amp;ldquo;To Read&amp;rdquo; bookmarks, &amp;ldquo;Saved&amp;rdquo; on Reddit and, the holy grail, &amp;ldquo;Read Later&amp;rdquo; of Feedly.
While the &amp;ldquo;Saved&amp;rdquo; section on Reddit was mostly threads from /r/cscarrearquestions (and some memes from /r/wsb ðŸ˜‚) the other two places were actual interesting articles that I have planned on reading.</description>

      <description>I came across a blogpost that explained how to add emoji&amp;rsquo;s to your terminal prompt, something like this:
The post is pretty good!
Not only explains how to add emoji&amp;rsquo;s to you prompt, but also goes a bit further on how to $RANDOM an emoji from a list of them, and bash formatting (customize the text in your terminal with colors and such).
Although I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with my terminal setup (shameless plug to ðŸ‘‰ my dotfilesðŸ‘ˆ ), I kept coming back to this idea.</description>
